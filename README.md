# pokepalette

Select pokemon sprites that match your wallpaper's palette!

## Usage:

Pokepalette tries to find your desktop wallpaper using two methods:

1. Pywal: by grabbing the palette from the autogenerated colors-rgb template located in your ~/.cache/wal directory
2. Wallpaper.rs: the rust wallpaper crate

### Flags

| Option          | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-k`            | The k nearest sprites to your desktop's Palette.                                                                           |
| `--no-shiny`    | Removes shiny sprites from the query.                                                                                      |
| `--no-mega`     | Removes mega sprites from the query.                                                                                       |
| `--no-regional` | Removes regional variant sprites from the query.                                                                           |
| `--verbose`     | Prints the current wallpaper Palette and the other k sprites' Palettes including their distances to the wallpaper palette. |

### Enhancements

1. Improve palette generation for more accurate results. By default, pokepalette generates a palette using
   8 colors (due to them being grabbed from pywal). Some sprites don't have enough colors to create a palette
   with 8 dominant colors. To correct this, I used the naive approach of padding color palettes. This could be improved
   in many ways. Will have to do some research and see.
2. Use command line argument library to fix some cli bugs
3. Add a feature to create a palette from any image
4. Add custom errors for clearer err messages
